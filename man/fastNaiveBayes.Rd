\description{
Extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier. The package currently supports
a Bernoulli distribution, a Multinomial distribution, and a Gaussian distribution, making it suitable for
both binary features, frequency counts, and numerical features.
Only numerical variables are allowed, however, categorical variables can be transformed into dummies
and used with the Bernoulli distribution.
}
\details{
This implementation offers a huge performance gain compared to the 'e1071' implementation in R.
The execution times were compared on a data set of tweets and was found to be 331 times faster. See the vignette for more
details. This performance gain is only realized using a Bernoulli event model. Furthermore, the Multinomial event model
is equally fast and available in contrast to 'e1071'
