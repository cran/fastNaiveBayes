\title{Fast Naive Bayes Classifier with a Bernoulli event model}
\usage{
fastNaiveBayes.bernoulli(x, y, laplace = 0, sparse = FALSE, ...)

\method{fastNaiveBayes.bernoulli}{default}(x, y, laplace = 0,
  sparse = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric matrix with 1's and 0's to indicate the presence or absence of features. A sparse dgcMatrix is also accepted}

\item{y}{a factor of classes}

\item{laplace}{A number used for Laplace smoothing. Default is 0}

\item{sparse}{Use a sparse matrix? If true a sparse matrix will be constructed from x, which can give up to a 40% speed up.
It's possible to directly feed a sparse dgcMatrix as x, which will set this parameter to TRUE}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A fitted object of class "fastNaiveBayes.bernoulli". It has four components:

    \describe{
        \item{probability_table}{Posterior probabilities}
        \item{priors}{calculated prior probabilities for each class}
        \item{names}{names of features used to train this fastNaiveBayes}
    }
}
\description{
Extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier. This instance only uses the
Bernoulli event model for all columns.
}
\details{
A Naive Bayes classifier that assumes independence between the feature variables. The bernoulli distribution should
    be used when the features are 0 or 1 to indicate the presence or absence of the feature in each document. NA's are simply treated as 0.

    By setting sparse = TRUE the numeric matrix x will be converted to a sparse dgcMatrix. This can be considerably faster
    in case few observations have a value different than 0.

    It's also possible to directly supply a sparse dgcMatrix, which can be a lot faster in case a fastNaiveBayes model
    is trained multiple times on the same matrix or a subset of this. See examples for more details. Bear in mind that
    converting to a sparse matrix can actually be slower depending on the data.
