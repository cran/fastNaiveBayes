\title{Fast Naive Bayes Classifier for mixed Distributions}
\usage{
fastNaiveBayes.mixed(x, y, laplace = 0, sparse = FALSE,
  distribution = NULL, ...)

\method{fastNaiveBayes.mixed}{default}(x, y, laplace = 0,
  sparse = FALSE, distribution = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric matrix, or a dgcMatrix}

\item{y}{a factor of classes}

\item{laplace}{A number used for Laplace smoothing. Default is 0}

\item{sparse}{Use a sparse matrix? If true a sparse matrix will be constructed from x, which can give up to a 40% speed up.
It's possible to directly feed a sparse dgcMatrix as x, which will set this parameter to TRUE}

\item{distribution}{A list with distribution names and column names to for which to use the distribution, see examples.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A fitted object of class "fastNaiveBayes". It has four components:

    \describe{
        \item{models}{The fitted models, one for each distribution specified}
        \item{priors}{calculated prior probabilities for each class}
        \item{names}{names of features used to train this fastNaiveBayes}
        \item{distribution}{the distribution assumed for probability calculations and predictions}
    }
}
\description{
Extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier.
}
\details{
A Naive Bayes classifier that assumes independence between the feature variables. Currently, either a Bernoulli,
    multinomial, or Gaussian distribution can be used. The bernoulli distribution should be used when the features are 0 or 1 to
    indicate the presence or absence of the feature in each document. The multinomial distribution should be used when the
    features are the frequency that the feature occurs in each document. NA's are simply treated as 0. Finally, the Gaussian distribution
    should be used with numerical variables. By setting the distribution parameter a mix of different distributions can be used
    for different columns in the input matrix

    By setting sparse = TRUE the numeric matrix x will be converted to a sparse dgcMatrix. This can be considerably faster
    in case few observations have a value different than 0.

    It's also possible to directly supply a sparse dgcMatrix, which can be a lot faster in case a fastNaiveBayes model
    is trained multiple times on the same matrix or a subset of this. See examples for more details. Bear in mind that
    converting to a sparse matrix can actually be slower depending on the data.
